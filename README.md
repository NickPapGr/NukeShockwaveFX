# Hi everyone, this is a mod that adds an awesome, dynamic ground shockwave for the standard nuke (as well as Manhattan tank) explosion.
The effect is taken from the Legion Expansion, special thanks to the respective creators
'Alpha2546' & 'Killerkiwijuice' for letting me implement and adapt their code.
